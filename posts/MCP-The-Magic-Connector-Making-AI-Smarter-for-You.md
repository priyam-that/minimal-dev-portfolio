## Imagine This...

You're sipping coffee on a Monday morning, feeling slightly overwhelmed.  
“Hey, can you plan my day?” you ask your AI assistant.

In seconds, it checks your calendar, schedules a meeting with your boss, books a train ticket for your evening trip, and even reminds you to carry an umbrella because it might rain.

Just one simple chat—no apps to open, no endless clicking. Sounds like a dream, right?

That’s exactly what the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** aims to achieve. It’s like giving your AI assistant superpowers—connecting it to all your apps so it can take action for you in a smart and seamless way.

---

## What Is MCP?

**Model Context Protocol (MCP)** is an open standard developed by **Anthropic** (the creators of Claude). It’s designed to let generative AI applications interact easily with your tools, services, and enterprise data.

> Think of it as a universal translator between your AI and the digital world around you.

---

## Why Use MCP?

MCP is like a **USB-C port** for AI apps.  
Just as USB-C lets you connect to different devices with one cable, MCP gives your AI a single way to connect to all sorts of external data sources—**without needing custom code** for every connection.

---

## How It Works (In Simple Terms)

MCP follows a **client-server model**, but let’s explain that in plain language.

### MCP Client  
This is your AI assistant (like Claude or any other GenAI app).  
It wants to get things done—like checking your calendar or booking a ticket—but needs access to the right tools.

### MCP Server  
This is the translator that sits between your AI and external services like Google Drive, Gmail, Salesforce, or your company’s database.  
Each service runs its own small MCP server that knows how to talk to the AI.

---

### So, when the AI needs something, it:

- Connects to the relevant MCP servers  
- Asks what tools are available  
- Uses the tools by sending standard requests  
- Gets back the result—without needing to know how the backend works

## Here's What the Conversation Looks Like Under the Hood

```plaintext
Handshake – AI: “Hey, what can you do?”

Menu – Server: “Here’s what I offer:”
  - get_current_weather(location: string)  
  - book_railway_ticket(date: string, destination: string)  
  - add_meeting_to_calendar(time: string, event_name: string)  

Request – AI: “Cool. I want to use get_current_weather. Location: Kolkata.”

Outcome – Server: “Got it! Here’s the weather info for Kolkata.”
